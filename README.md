Homework and projects for ECE264: Advanced C programming.

This repository documents my work and progress in ECE264 taken in spring 2025. 
Through this course, I was able to master the use of file IO, recursion, structs, and dynamic data structures in C. 

Some notable work in this repository includes BFS, Queues, Binary Trees, and Huffman Compression.
